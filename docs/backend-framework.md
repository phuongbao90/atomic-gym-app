## Introduction
The Atomic Gym Tracker is a fitness application designed to help users manage their workout plans effectively. Users can select predefined workout plans, create new ones, track their performed sets, and review past workout sessions. This document outlines the backend framework for the application using Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.

## API Architecture and Endpoints Organization

### RESTful API Design Patterns
- The API will adhere to RESTful design principles, ensuring stateless operations and resource-based URL patterns.
- Endpoints will be organized by resource type (e.g., `/workout-plans`, `/sessions`, `/users`).

### Naming Conventions for Endpoints
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions:
  - `GET /api/v1/workout-plans`: Retrieve all workout plans.
  - `POST /api/v1/workout-plans`: Create a new workout plan.
  - `GET /api/v1/workout-plans/{id}`: Retrieve a specific workout plan.
  - `PUT /api/v1/workout-plans/{id}`: Update a workout plan.
  - `DELETE /api/v1/workout-plans/{id}`: Delete a workout plan.

### Request/Response Formats
- **Request format**: JSON
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Full Body Workout",
    "exercises": [
      {
        "name": "Push-up",
        "reps": 15,
        "sets": 3
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Response format**: JSON
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "workoutPlan": {
        "id": "123",
        "name": "Full Body Workout",
        "exercises": [...]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Versioning Strategy
- Use URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to manage API changes.

### Middleware Organization
- Use middleware for authentication, logging, error handling, and request validation.
  - Example: `app.use('/api/v1/workout-plans', workoutPlanRoutes);`

### Detailed Route Handlers
- Separate business logic from route handlers using service classes or functions.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const createWorkoutPlan = async (req, res) => {
        try {
            const plan = await workoutPlanService.create(req.body);
            res.status(201).json({ status: 'success', data: { plan } });
        } catch (error) {
            next(error);
        }
    };
    ```

## Database Schema Design

### ORM Integration
- Use Prisma ORM for type-safe database interactions with PostgreSQL.

### Connection Optimization
- Utilize connection pooling with environment-specific configurations.

### Transaction Management
- Employ Prisma's transaction API for operations requiring atomicity.

### Query Optimization
- Use indexes appropriately and perform query analysis to minimize execution time.

### Migration Approach
- Use Prisma Migrate for database schema changes, ensuring version control for migrations.

## Authentication/Authorization Approach

### JWT Implementation
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.
- Secure tokens with strong encryption algorithms (e.g., RS256).

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implement RBAC to manage different permission levels (e.g., admin, user).

### Session Management
- Use HTTP-only cookies for session management with JWT.

### Refresh Token Strategies
- Implement refresh tokens to maintain user sessions securely.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Centralized Error Handling
- Use a centralized error handler middleware to manage errors consistently.

### Custom Error Classes
- Define a hierarchy of custom error classes for different error types (e.g., ValidationError, NotFoundError).

### Logging and Monitoring
- Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Winston, Sentry) for error logging.

### User-Friendly Error Responses
- Provide clear error messages without exposing internal details.

### Error Recovery Mechanisms
- Implement retries and fallbacks where appropriate.

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategies
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data to enhance performance.

### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting using libraries like `express-rate-limit` to prevent abuse.

### Database Connection Pooling
- Configure connection pooling to efficiently handle database connections.

### Query Optimization
- Analyze and optimize queries to reduce execution time and improve responsiveness.

### Horizontal Scaling
- Design the application for horizontal scaling, using load balancers and multiple instances.

## Security Implementations

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

### CSRF Protection
- Implement CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery.

### CORS Configuration
- Configure CORS to allow trusted domains and secure cross-origin requests.

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Use parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection.

### XSS Protection Strategies
- Encode outputs and sanitize inputs to prevent cross-site scripting.

### Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection
- Implement rate limits on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.

### Data Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using database-level encryption.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
- Use Jest or Mocha for unit testing of business logic and components.

### Integration Testing Methodology
- Test interactions between components using tools like Supertest.

### End-to-End Testing Recommendations
- Utilize tools like Cypress for comprehensive end-to-end testing.

### Mock Frameworks and Testing Tools
- Use Sinon for mocking and spying in tests.

## Deployment and DevOps

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.

### Environment Configuration Management
- Use dotenv for managing environment variables and configuration.

### Containerization Approach
- Use Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.

### Infrastructure as Code
- Use Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for managing infrastructure as code.
