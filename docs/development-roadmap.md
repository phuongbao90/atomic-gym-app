- Add additional workout templates
- Refine UI/UX based on user feedback

**Version 2.0 (Week 17-20)**
- Implement AI-driven workout recommendations
- Introduce multi-user support for trainers

## 2. Timeline Estimates

### Critical Path Identification
- User authentication and workout plan creation are critical for MVP.
- Dependencies include third-party API integration and database setup.

### Resource Allocation
- 2 Frontend Developers
- 1 Backend Developer
- 1 QA Engineer
- 1 UI/UX Designer
- 1 Product Manager

### Buffer and Milestones
- Allocate 1-week buffer after MVP phase for unexpected challenges.
- Key Milestones: MVP Completion (Week 6), Alpha Release (Week 8), Production Release (Week 12)

## 3. Feature Prioritization

### MoSCoW Method

- **Must Have:**
  - User registration and authentication
  - Workout plan selection and creation
  - Workout session tracking

- **Should Have:**
  - Session review
  - Advanced metrics tracking

- **Could Have:**
  - AI-driven recommendations
  - Social sharing features

- **Won't Have:**
  - Multi-language support (in initial releases)

### Impact vs. Effort Matrix
- Prioritize features with high impact and low effort.

### Risk Assessment
- High risk: Third-party API reliability
- Mitigation: Use fallback mechanisms and caching

## 4. Technical Debt Strategy

- **Prevention:** Regular code reviews and adherence to coding standards.
- **Identification:** Use static analysis tools to identify code smells.
- **Refactoring Cycles:** Integrate refactoring into sprint cycles.
- **Code Quality Metrics:** Ensure 80% unit test coverage.
- **Long-term Sustainability:** Modular architecture to facilitate easy updates.

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development:** Adopt TDD for core features.
- **Unit Testing:** Use Jest for unit tests with 80% coverage target.
- **Integration Testing:** Employ Testing Library to verify component interactions.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Use Cypress for simulating user workflows.
- **Performance Testing:** Use Lighthouse to ensure application speed.
- **Security Testing:** Conduct vulnerability scans with OWASP ZAP.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Conduct sessions with a selected user group.

## 6. Multi-Environment Deployment Strategy

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement using GitHub Actions.
- **Containerization:** Use Docker for consistent environment setup.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Use Terraform for infrastructure management.
- **Environment Promotion:** Implement dev → staging → production workflow.
- **Rollback Procedures:** Set up automated rollback in case of failures.
- **Monitoring:** Use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
- **Database Migration:** Use Flyway for managing database changes.

## 7. Risk Management Plan

- **Potential Risks:**
  - API downtime
  - Security breaches

- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Implement fallback systems
  - Regular security audits

- **Contingency Planning:** Maintain a disaster recovery protocol.
- **Review Points:** Conduct bi-weekly risk assessments.

## 8. Team Structure and Collaboration Model

- **Roles and Responsibilities:**
  - Frontend Developers: UI development and integration
  - Backend Developer: API and server-side logic
  - QA Engineer: Testing and quality assurance
  - UI/UX Designer: User interface and experience design
  - Product Manager: Project coordination and stakeholder communication

- **Communication Protocols:** Daily stand-ups, weekly sprint reviews.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Use Confluence for documentation.
- **Agile/Scrum Implementation:** Follow two-week sprint cycles.

## Conclusion
This roadmap provides a comprehensive guide to developing Atomic Gym Tracker with a focus on phased releases, prioritization, technical excellence, and robust testing and deployment strategies. By adhering to this plan, the development team can ensure a successful and timely delivery of a high-quality fitness application.
